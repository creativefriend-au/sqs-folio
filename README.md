# Creative Friend Portfolio

## About

Custom code snippets from our June 2023 Portfolio on Squarespace.

While Bootstrap & Wordpress still has a special place in our coding hearts. We decided to build our portfolio website using Squarespace, experimenting with their new fluid engine and pushing the boundaries what a site builder can do.

## Experiments

In this folder are some code snippets for various parts of our site. No styling - just div blocks. I also may or may not have got ChatGPT to convert this (https://codepen.io/maryambafandkar/pen/WNrJxR) jQuery code into VanillaJS. Please note, many are also broken. Enjoy!
